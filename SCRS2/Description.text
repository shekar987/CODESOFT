The Course Registration System (SCRS2) is a Java-based application designed to
manage course registrations for students in an educational institution. At its 
core, the system consists of several Java classes, each playing a specific role 
in ensuring the smooth functioning of the registration process.

Starting with the SCRS2 class, it serves as the entry point for the application,
initializing a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java's Swing framework. Upon
launching, the main JFrame window is set up, encapsulating a MenuPanel that
provides a user-friendly interface for course registration operations.

Two primary entities govern the core functionalities: Students and Courses. The
Student class defines a student's attributes, such as a unique studentID and a 
name. Additionally, it manages a set of courses for which a student is registered
or has dropped. On the other hand, the Course class represents individual courses, 
including details like courseCode, title, description, capacity, and schedule. 
Functionality within this class allows students to register or drop courses based on available slots.

Facilitating interactions between the GUI and persistent storage is the CourseRegistrationSystem class.
This intermediary class leverages the DatabaseManager class, which employs JDBC to interact with a
MySQL database. The DatabaseManager handles operations like fetching course and student data from the 
database and updating records when a student registers or drops a course.

Now, diving into the GUI aspect, the MenuPanel class is pivotal. It presents a table listing
available courses and buttons for essential actions: displaying courses, registering students,
dropping courses, and exiting the application. The table dynamically updates its content based
on operations performed, ensuring real-time visibility into available slots for each course.

In essence, the SCRS2 project amalgamates database operations, student-course relationships,
and a user-friendly interface to streamline the course registration process. By leveraging Java's 
capabilities, it offers educators an efficient tool to manage enrollments while providing students an
accessible platform to select and register for courses of their choice.
