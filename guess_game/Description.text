The Guess_number_game Java program is a simple number guessing game that allows users to guess a randomly generated number between
1 and 100 within a limited number of attempts. The game starts by initializing essential components, including a Scanner for user input 
and a Random object to generate the target number.

Upon execution, the game prompts users to play multiple rounds. In each round, a random number between 1 and 100 is generated as the target.
The user then has up to 8 attempts to guess this number correctly. After each guess, the program provides feedback, indicating whether the
guess is too high or too low, and informs the user about the remaining attempts. If the user correctly guesses the number within the allotted 
attempts, they win the round, and the game tracks the total number of rounds won.

The game continues in a loop, allowing users to play multiple rounds if desired. After each round, users are prompted to decide whether 
they want to continue playing. Upon opting out, the program displays the total number of rounds won. However, if users exceed the maximum
number of attempts in any round without guessing correctly, the game reveals the correct number, signaling the end of that specific round.
Overall, the Guess_number_game provides an engaging and interactive experience centered on probability and guessing skills.
