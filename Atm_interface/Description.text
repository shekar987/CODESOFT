The AtmInterface project is a simple Java-based ATM simulation designed to offer basic banking functionalities such as withdrawal, deposit, 
and balance checking. At its core, the system revolves around an interactive menu-driven approach where users can navigate through different options 
to manage their account.

Upon initiating the program, users are presented with a menu displaying four primary options:

Withdraw: This option prompts users to enter an amount they wish to withdraw from their account. If the requested amount is available, the system 
processes the withdrawal, deducting the amount from theaccount balance. However, if the user attempts to withdraw more than the available balance,
a message indicating insufficient funds is displayed.

Deposit: Here, users can input an amount they intend to deposit into their account. Once confirmed, the system updates the account balance by adding
the deposited amount, ensuring the balance reflects the latest financial activity.

Check Balance: This straightforward option allows users to retrieve and view their current account balance instantly, providing them with a snapshot 
of their financial status.

Exit: Lastly, users have the liberty to exit the ATM interface, concluding their session and terminating the program execution.

Driving the functionalities is the UserBankAccount class, which serves as the backbone of the ATM simulation. This class encapsulates essential
attributes and methods pertinent to a typical bank account. The balance attribute tracks the current account balance, initialized to 500 units
in this implementation. Methods like withdraw(int amount) and deposit(int amount) facilitate the withdrawal and deposit operations, respectively. 
For withdrawals, the system validates the availability of funds before processing, while deposits directly augment the existing balance.

Overall, the AtmInterface project exemplifies a foundational ATM system, providing users with a streamlined interface to conduct fundamental
banking operations within the confines of a console-based application.
