The QuizApp is a Java-based interactive quiz application designed to challenge userswith a series of multiple-choice questions. 
The application integrates a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Swing components, providing an intuitive user experience. Upon launching, 
the user is presented with questions on various topics, ranging from geography to literature. Each question has a time limit, and users must select 
the correct answer from the provided options within this timeframe.A timer keeps track of the remaining time for each question, enhancing the sense
of urgency and engagement.After answering all questions or when time runs out, the application displays the user's score and highlights
correct/incorrect responses. Users have the option to replay the quiz or exit the application. The underlying structure employs a Question class 
to encapsulate individual questions, making the application modular and scalable. Overall, the QuizApp offers an interactive platform for users 
to test their knowledge, combining Java programming with a user-centric design approach.
